            <p> 
                In 1996, while playing guitar in the band Pinwheel, Gibbard recorded a demo cassette under the moniker 
                Death Cab for Cutie, titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords (1997). After receiving a positive response 
                to the material, Gibbard expanded the project into a full band, with the addition of guitarist Chris Walla, 
                bassist Nick Harmer and drummer Nathan Good. The following year, the band released its debut album, Something 
                About Airplanes (1998), on Barsuk Records.

                Depper began his career playing with various Pacific NW artists, including Menomena, Fruit Bats, Mirah, Corin Tucker, 
                and Laura Gibson. In 2014, Depper joined Ray LaMontagne's touring band; he was later recruited by Indie Rock
                pioneers Death Cab for Cutie during their 2015 world tour in support of their eighth album.Following 
                the departure of member Chris Walla, Depper and fellow musician Zac Rae joined Death Cab as full-time members, receiving 
                credits on the band's ninth album, Thank You for Today.

                McGerr was born and raised in Bellingham, Washington. At age ten, he began learning to play the drums in order to 
                get into his middle school band. By 16, he was playing paid gigs at local bars. In a 2018 interview with KEXP, he 
                stated that he knew he wanted to do drumming professionally when he heard Led Zeppelin's "Black Dog" for the first time at 14. 
                He was an avid fisher growing up, and worked at H&H Sporting Goods, a local fly shop, throughout high school.

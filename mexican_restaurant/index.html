        <h1>Our Founder</h1>
        <p>
            Gabriela Camara is one of Mexico’s leading culinary diplomats who runs two iconic restaurants - Contramar in Mexico City and Cala in San Francisco. In 2019, she was appointed to the Mexican government's Council of Cultural Diplomacy and as an advisor to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
            
            The restaurateur and author, Camara was born in Chihuahua City and grew up in Tepoztlán with her brother. Her father is a former Jesuit priest who moved to Chihuahua City to build a school and a health center. Her mother, who completed a doctoral dissertation on mosaics in southern Italy, also joined the cause. Her mother grew up in Philadelphia. Cámara speaks English and Spanish fluently. <br>
            
            
            
            
            Five years after she moved to the United States from her native Mexico, she is at the tipping point of world culinary fame. Her 20-year-old restaurant, Contramar, is both a beloved institution and a power-lunch destination: the Union Square Cafe of Mexico City. Her San Francisco restaurant, Cala, has established her here as both an eloquent translator of modern Mexican food and an advocate for social justice: She provides health insurance and other benefits to all full-time employees, many of whom are recruited through job programs for the formerly incarcerated. <br>

            A glowing documentary film about the restaurants, “A Tale of Two Kitchens,” executive-produced by the actor Gael García Bernal, premiered two weeks ago on Netflix. She has just published a cookbook, “My Mexico City Kitchen” (Lorena Jones Books). This summer she will open a restaurant in Los Angeles with Jessica Koslow of Sqirl, whose casually fabulous cooking mirrors her own. </p>
